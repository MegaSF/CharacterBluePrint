# CharacterBluePrint

This file is meant to do one main thing: Create a basic abstraction or blueprint of a character in a typical role playing game.

The goal is to be able to use this to create playable and non playable characters alike, however the user wants to use it in their project

There is one other feature too, and that is we don't use if/else statements, instead using math to replace them all (as a fun challenge)

future updates to this will include more features listed at bottom, plus, well, actual documentation
